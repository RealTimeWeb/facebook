Welcome to Stock Service's documentation!
=========================================

The Stock Service library offers access to the Google's Finance feed.
This is stock data available from U.S. exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE and
covers a wide variety of stocks.

Note that this data stream has a very high velocity - if you check every five minutes, you'll find it may have already changed.

>>> import stockservice

You can get information for any stock, for example let's get information for Apple

>>> stock_dict = stockservice.get_stock_information("AAPL")
>>> stock_dict
{'last_trade_date_and_time': u'May 22, 11:25AM EDT', 'ticker_name': u'AAPL', 'last_trade_price': 605.51, 'exchange_name': u'NASDAQ', 'change_percentage': -0.13, 'change_number': -0.8}

If you wish to access information within the dictionary, you can do so by
specifying the key to use and the value will be returned.

>>> stock_dict['change_number']
0.99
>>> stock_dict['last_trade_date_and_time']
'May 22, 11:25AM EDT'
>>> stock_dict['last_trade_price']
605.51

Here is the complete list of information that can be retrieved from the dictionary

The built-in cache allows you to work online:

>>> stockservice.connect() # unnecessary: default is connected

or offline:

>>> stockservice.disconnect()
>>> stockservice.get_stock_information("AAPL")
{'last_trade_date_and_time': u'May 21, 11:25AM EDT', 'ticker_name': u'AAPL', 'last_trade_price': 603.55, 'exchange_name': u'NASDAQ', 'change_percentage': -0.19, 'change_number': -1.16}

But remember there must be data in the cache already!

>>> stock = stockservice.get_stock_information("AAPL")
stockservice.StockServiceException: There were no results

Populating the cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Say you want to add Apple's stock (AAPL) to the cache

>>> stockservice._start_editing()
>>> stock = stockservice.get_stock_information("AAPL")
>>> stockservice._save_cache()

Now the file "cache.json" file will have an entry for ("AAPL"), and
you can use that as an input to the function when disconnected.

You can also create a different cache file by passing a filename to the
_save_cache() method, and use that cache by passing its name to the
disconnect() method.

For example, this will populate a file called "goog.json", which will contain
stock information for google

>>> stockservice._start_editing()
>>> goog_stock = stockservice.get_stock_information("GOOG")
>>> stockservice._save_cache('goog.json')

To use that cached file, specify the json file name when you call disconnect():

>>> stockservice.disconnect("goog.json")

Finally, you can put multiple entries into the cache for a given input, simulating multiple calls. These items will be appended. If the cache runs out, it will start returning empty reports.

>>> stockservice.connect()
>>> stockservice._start_editing()
>>> goog_stock = stockservice.get_stock_information("GOOG")
>>> aapl_stock = stockservice.get_stock_information("AAPL")
>>> stockservice._save_cache()
>>> stockservice.disconnect()
>>> stockservice.get_stock_information("GOOG")
{'last_trade_date_and_time': u'May 22, 12:40PM EDT', 'ticker_name': u'GOOG', 'last_trade_price': 542.66, 'exchange_name': u'NASDAQ', 'change_percentage': 0.69, 'change_number': 3.72}
>>> stockservice.get_stock_information("AAPL")
{'last_trade_date_and_time': u'May 21, 11:26AM EDT', 'ticker_name': u'AAPL', 'last_trade_price': 603.55, 'exchange_name': u'NASDAQ', 'change_percentage': -0.19, 'change_number': -1.16}
